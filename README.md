Updated Portfolio Assignment

This project has been my favorite so far in the BootCamp. Wek one of the BootCamp we had a similar project, creating our first Portfolio. It is so very cool to look back on that, and compare it to this one. I have learned so much and it is awesome to see it all coming together. I also like this because it is setting me up for graduation, I will have a full portfolio ready to go by the end of this Bootcamp.

I had fun with this, I spent a lot of time researching professional vs non professional, mostly in the styling department. What colors, fonts and displays speak professonalism, which don't? Im looking forward to adding more to my Portfolio as the BootCamp progresses!
